# Calculation performance

opengrads-hpc can use OpenMP for common in-memory grid calculations. The default
is **4 calculation threads**. OpenMP is detected automatically by
`configure`; no extra user action is needed with a supported GCC, Clang, or
vendor compiler.

## Choosing the CPU count

Choose the setting that fits the machine and workload:

```text
ga-> q threads
Calculation threads = 4 (OpenMP enabled)
ga-> set threads 8
Calculation threads set to 8
```

The same choice can be made at startup:

```bash
./opengrads -j 8
GA_NUM_THREADS=8 ./opengrads
```

Precedence is `-j N`, then `GA_NUM_THREADS`, then the default of 4. A script
may change the count at any time with `set threads N`. Use `set threads 1` for
a serial calculation or for output-comparison testing.

Do not automatically select every logical CPU on a shared node. Start with 4,
then benchmark 2, 4, 8, and so on against the real command script. Memory
bandwidth often limits grid arithmetic before all cores are useful.

## How long it will take

A calculation that runs for more than a second shows a progress line on the
terminal while it works: what is running, how far along it is, the
calculation threads at work (`set threads`), how long it has taken, and about
how long is left.

```text
ga-> d ave(t,t=1,t=2920)
Averaging.  dim = 3, start = 1, end = 2920
ave [██████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]  35%  1022/2920  4 threads  0:41, about 1:16 left
```

It follows `ave`, `mean`, `sum`, `sumg`, `min`, `max`, `minloc`, `maxloc`,
`tloop`, `eloop`, `gint`, and `define`. A calculation inside another counts
as part of its step, so `define x = ave(t,t-30,t+30)` over a year of days
shows one line, `define > ave`, that moves as each average does. The line is
taken away before anything else is printed and when the command ends, so the
output reads as before, and it never appears when the output goes to a file
or a pipe, or inside a script's `result`. In iTerm2 (outside tmux) the
progress also shows in iTerm2's own progress bar. Ctrl-C stops the
calculation as usual.

`GA_PROGRESS=off` turns the line off; a number sets how many seconds a
calculation runs before it appears (default 1).

## Accelerated calculations

The implementation parallelizes independent cells in the hot, thread-safe
parts of expression evaluation, including:

- grid/scalar arithmetic, comparisons, powers, masks, `mag`, and `atan2`;
- `sqrt`, trigonometric functions, `abs`, `exp`, `log`, and `log10`;
- `mean`, `ave`, `sum`, `sumg`, `min`, `max`, `minloc`, and `maxloc`;
- `amean`, `aave`, `asum`, and `atot` area reductions;
- `gint`, `vint`, `const`, `cdiff`, and `smth9`.

Small grids remain serial because creating a thread team costs more than it
saves. The current crossover is 32,768 cells. File reads, expression parsing,
coordinate conversion setup, and graphics remain serial because the legacy
core keeps mutable global state in those paths.

## Time averages of BP5 data

`ave`, `mean`, `sum`, `sumg`, `min`, `max`, `minloc`, and `maxloc` over time
evaluate their expression once per time step, and each step used to be a
separate read. When the expression is a plain variable of a BP5 dataset that
is the default file (`ave(th,t=1,t=1441)`, not `ave(th*2,...)` or a defined
variable), the steps are instead read many at a time: up to 256 steps, or
64 MB, go to ADIOS2 as one batch, which its reader threads serve in parallel,
and they are folded into the result on the calculation threads. Each grid
point still takes its steps in order through the same accumulation code, so
the result matches the step-by-step path; the BP5 regression compares the two
for exact equality at one and at four threads. Any other expression, file
format, or a step outside the file goes step by step as before.

BP5 reads of a vertical section (x-z or y-z) and of a profile are also one
read per step now, rather than one per level.

On a 96 × 96 × 300 dataset of 241 steps, written as 16 blocks per step the way
a 16-rank run writes it, with the data in the page cache and 4 threads:

| Request | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x-z section, `ave(th,t=1,t=241)` | 5.5 s | 0.06 s |
| profile, `ave(th,t=1,t=241)` | 0.19 s | 0.01 s |
| x-y map, `ave(th,t=1,t=241)` | 0.04 s | 0.02 s |
| `define m = ave(th,t=1,t=241)` over all 300 levels | 13.6 s | 3.3 s |

The 3-D `define` evaluates the average one level at a time, so it remains
bounded by reading 300 separate planes per batch of steps; with one thread it
takes 4.0 s.

## Averages over x, y and z

An average over x, y or z also evaluates its expression once per position:
`ave(ave(th,x=1,x=256),y=1,y=256)` drawn as a profile read a column of `th`
for every point of the plane, 65,536 reads, and with BP5 each of them went
through the whole block the column lies in. Calculation threads do not help
with that, since the time goes into the reads. Now, when the expression is a
plain variable of the default file and the result varies in one dimension at
most (a horizontal-mean profile, a zonal-mean line, a single value), every
position is read at once, as one section of up to 256 MB, and averaged from
memory. Every file format takes this path. Weights (latitude, `-b` bounds),
wrap-around in longitude and positions outside the file are handled as
before, and `pytests/TestAveSection.sh` checks that each result matches, to
the last bit, the one taken a position at a time. Any other expression, or a
map or section as the result, still reads a position at a time.

On a BP5 dataset of 256 × 256 × 100, the profile
`d ave(ave(th,x=1,x=256),y=1,y=256)` with `set z 1 100` took 12.8 s at one
thread and at four; it now takes 0.6 s, start-up included.

For a time-mean profile, average over time first and over the plane after:

```text
ga-> define tm = ave(th,t=1,t=241)
ga-> set x 1
ga-> set y 1
ga-> d ave(ave(tm,x=1,x=96),y=1,y=96)
```

The `define` reads many times at once (see above), and the profile is then
taken from memory.

## Reproducibility of parallel reductions

Parallel reductions can differ from a one-thread result in the last few
floating-point bits because additions may be grouped differently. Missing
value masks and scientific semantics are unchanged. Use an appropriate
tolerance rather than requiring bit-for-bit equality for nontrivial sums.

## Build controls and verification

Force a serial build when required:

```bash
./configure --disable-openmp
```

To require OpenMP and fail configuration when it is unavailable:

```bash
./configure --enable-openmp
```

The configuration banner and `q config` report whether OpenMP was compiled
in. After building `grads` and `libgxdummy.la`, run:

```bash
OPENGRADS_BUILD_ROOT=/path/to/build ./pytests/TestOpenMP.sh
```

The test exercises a 256x256 grid, checks the four-thread default and runtime
controls, and compares common calculation output at one and four threads.

## Reproducible large-case benchmark

Run the supplied benchmark after building `grads` and `libgxdummy.la`:

```bash
OPENGRADS_BUILD_ROOT="$PWD/build" ./benchmarks/BenchmarkOpenMP.sh
```

It creates a sparse 2048 x 2048 float dataset with six time steps, warms the
file cache, and runs six repetitions of a mixed workload: elementwise
transcendental arithmetic, `amean`, `aave`, `asum`, `mean`, and `sum`. It then
reports the median of three complete runs at one CPU and at the selected CPU
count. Override its defaults with `OPENGRADS_BENCH_THREADS`,
`OPENGRADS_BENCH_SIZE`, `OPENGRADS_BENCH_TIMES`,
`OPENGRADS_BENCH_REPEATS`, and `OPENGRADS_BENCH_TRIALS`.

On 22 August 2026, the default case produced this result on an aarch64 system
where `nproc` exposed five CPUs (heterogeneous Cortex-X925/Cortex-A725 host):

| Calculation CPUs | Median seconds | Speedup |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 (original/single CPU) | 9.31 | 1.00x |
| 4 | 5.05 | 1.84x |

This is an end-to-end result for one synthetic workload, not a universal
scaling promise. File access, parsing, allocation, and other legacy global
state remain serial, so pure arithmetic kernels can scale better while
I/O-heavy scripts can scale less.

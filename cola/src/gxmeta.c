/* Undo support.  The meta buffer is a replayable record of everything drawn
   since the last frame action, so a position in it is all that is needed to
   put the picture back: rewind to the position and redraw.  A position is
   only meaningful within the frame it was taken in, so a reset of the
   buffer chain drops the saved steps and gives the chain a new generation,
   which also catches a position taken before a reset and offered after one.

   A clear is the exception.  When the clear command asks for it
   (gxhundoframe), the chain is not reset but set aside, and the step of the
   command that cleared keeps it: undoing that step puts the old chain back,
   generation and all, so the steps taken in it apply again.  A command that
   clears more than once (a script) sets aside the first frame only.

   Each step also carries the caller's state from before its command, which
   gxhundo hands back for the caller to put back; a step that is dropped
   instead hands it to the routine named with gxhundofn. */

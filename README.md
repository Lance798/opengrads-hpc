# opengrads-hpc

opengrads-hpc is a maintained fork of OpenGrADS 2.2.1.oga.1, GrADS built for
modern simulation output. It keeps the interactive GrADS workflow — the same
descriptors, commands, and `.gs` scripts — while adding an ADIOS2/BP5 reader,
OpenMP-threaded calculations, and self-contained releases for Linux and
macOS.

**"HPC" means the ADIOS2/BP5 engine plus OpenMP threading on a single node.**
There is no MPI or GPU support and none is planned; ADIOS2 is deliberately
built with `ADIOS2_USE_MPI=OFF`. Data written by a multi-rank MPI job is read
serially.

Releases are versioned independently of GrADS: archives are named
`opengrads-hpc-<version>`, while `grads` still reports the GrADS baseline it
matches (`2.2.1.oga.1`). Each archive carries a `VERSION` file with both. See
[release documentation](docs/RELEASES.md).

Licensed under **GPL-2.0-only**, inherited from GrADS. Using it and building it
carry no obligations; redistributing the BP5-enabled binaries has one
documented caveat. See [licensing and usage rules](docs/LICENSING.md).

## What is GrADS?

The Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) is an interactive environment for
working with gridded and station earth-science data. It lets users open data,
select a longitude/latitude/level/time domain, evaluate expressions, and make
maps, contours, vectors, time series, and other scientific plots. GrADS also
has a scripting language for repeatable analysis and batch graphics.

This fork retains the familiar GrADS data model and commands, including support
for common binary, GRIB, NetCDF, HDF, and BUFR workflows when their optional
libraries are available.

## What this project adds

- **ADIOS2 BP5 reader.** Open supported BP5 output directly with
  `bpopen /path/to/data.bp`, without writing a CTL file, or use an explicit
  descriptor with `dtype bp5`. Coordinate, variable, unit, title, and
  missing-value metadata are discovered where available. See
  [BP5 documentation](docs/BP5.md).

- **OpenMP calculation engine.** Common grid arithmetic, functions, and
  reductions can use multiple CPU cores. The default is four calculation
  threads; control it with `set threads N`, `./opengrads -j N`, or
  `GA_NUM_THREADS=N`. A long `ave`, `sum`, `tloop`, `define` and the like
  shows a progress line with the time left. See
  [performance notes](docs/PERFORMANCE.md).

- **Restored self-describing-file access.** Release builds require NetCDF and
  UDUNITS support, so `sdfopen` and `xdfopen` remain available for compatible
  NetCDF and HDF data instead of disappearing from the command set. Confirm
  enabled features with `q config`.

- **Advanced scripts and extensions.** The bundled OpenGrADS/Kodama script
  collection in [lib/scripts](lib/scripts) provides reusable plotting and
  analysis tools, including maps, panels, colour bars, meteorograms,
  trajectories, and interpolation helpers. Plotting scripts from Bin Guan's
  bGASL add 1-D graphs, shading with contours, vertical cross-sections,
  vectors, multi-panel layouts, legends, and publication-ready output. Existing OpenGrADS extensions are
  retained under [extensions](extensions).

- **Plots in the terminal, no X needed.** Over ssh from iTerm2, the picture
  appears in a tmux pane beside the `ga->` prompt and updates after each
  command, with no X server or `ssh -X`. Animations play frame by frame as
  they are drawn, as in an X window, and slow transfers show iTerm2's
  progress bar. The launcher picks it automatically, on Linux and on a Mac.
  See [terminal display](docs/TERMINAL.md).

- **Undo for the plot.** Step the picture back one command at a time, on
  from start-up with ten steps kept: `undo` rewinds one, `undo <n>` several,
  `set undo <steps>` keeps another number and `set undo off` turns it off,
  a whole script counts as a single step, and `clear` can be undone too. The
  picture comes back with what GrADS knows about it (axis ranges, scaling,
  shading levels); settings and open files stay. See
  [undo documentation](docs/UNDO.md).

- **Modern interactive and release experience.** Optional GNU Readline adds
  command history and Tab completion. Ctrl-C clears a half-typed command, as
  in a shell, and interrupts a running one, but never ends GrADS. The release builders produce three
  self-contained archives — Linux x86_64 and aarch64, and macOS arm64 —
  carrying BP5, OpenMP, the graphics plug-ins available on that platform, and
  every required runtime library.

## Quick start

For a packaged release, follow [RELEASES.md](docs/RELEASES.md); it says at
start-up when a newer release is out, and `./opengrads --update` installs it.
For a
source build, follow [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md). Once started, a BP5 session
can look like this:

```text
ga-> bpopen /path/to/output.bp
ga-> q vars
ga-> set t 1
ga-> set z 1
ga-> set threads 8
ga-> set gxout shaded
ga-> display temperature
```

Use `q config` to see whether this build includes `adios2-bp5`, `openmp`,
`netcdf`, graphics devices, and other optional components.

## Legacy OpenGrADS documentation

The [pre-fork OpenGrADS README](https://github.com/Aaron-Hsieh-0129/opengrads-hpc/blob/3c0ea22b3c592ccfcc876da442da61a37bb1d23c/README)
is retained in the repository history for the original project overview and
older installation guidance. The historical [BUILD](BUILD) and [INSTALL](INSTALL)
files are also preserved, but the documentation above describes this fork's
supported build and release process.
